# Let's start simple... this is a program that outputs the phrase "Hello World!" to the terminal window.
puts("Hello World!");

# The "puts" statement above tells the computer to write something to the terminal window. This is what's called a function.
# The parantheses tell the puts statement where to find what it needs to display in the terminal, which will be inside the parentheses.
# The semicolon tells Ruby where the current statement ends, and where to start the next statement in the program.
# The "Hello World!" in quotations tells the puts statement what to display in the terminal. This is what's called a parameter.
